# Raycaster
Built in c++ using raylibs C libary. Dont know why I built it in the C libary and not the cpp wrapper, but here I am.
I think the C version of the libary provides a simplicity that I enjoy, and the cpp libary is mixed with functions and objects, so I'm not a huge fan of it.

## Usage
(Dont know if this will build on linux)
1. Instal raylib on your system
2. clone
3. make
4. ./bin/main
